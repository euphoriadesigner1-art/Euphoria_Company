# "Immersive AI" Design Document: Euphoria Company

## Overview
Euphoria Company is an AI web development and automation agency. The web presence must reflect cutting-edge capabilities and a highly technical, premium positioning.

## Visual Direction: "Sleek Dark" / Immersive AI
- **Primary Vibe:** Premium, modern, futuristic, immersive.
- **Color Palette:** 
    - DOMINANT: Pitch Black (`#000000`) to Deep Slate.
    - ACCENT 1: Premium Gold (`#FFD700` or similar metallic hue) for high-value CTAs and subtle glowing borders.
    - ACCENT 2: Electric/Neon Blue (`#00F0FF`) for AI-related active states and data visualizations.
- **Typography:**
    - Headings: Satoshi or out-of-the-box system-ui (Inter/SF Pro) but heavily weighted.
    - Body: General Sans or Inter.
- **UI Elements:**
    - Glassmorphism (heavy blur backgrounds on panels).
    - Very thin borders (`border-white/10` or `border-gold/20`).
    - Fluid, sweeping hover states (no sudden snaps).
    - Floating elements.

## Core Sections & User Journey
1. **Hero:** 
   - Massive, high-contrast typography ("We Build The Future").
   - Immersive 3D/Canvas element or complex CSS morphing gradient representing an "AI Core".
   - Primary CTA: "Start Your Project".
2. **Services (Bento Grid or Floating Cards):** 
   - AI Web Development, Automation Workflows, Custom Solutions.
   - Interactive hover states revealing technical details.
3. **Portfolio/Case Studies:**
   - Image-heavy, dark overlays. 
   - Metrics-focused (e.g., "Increased conversion by 40%").
4. **How it Works (Process):**
   - A timeline or scrolling interactive list showing Discovery -> Implementation -> Handoff.
5. **Testimonials:**
   - Clean, readable text with subtle glowing avatars.
6. **Footer / Contact:**
   - Large lead-gen form, minimal input fields, big glowing submit button.

## Technical Architecture (Anticipated)
- **Stack:** HTML/Vanilla CSS/Vite (or Next.js if advanced routing is needed, but sticking to core web components first for visual fidelity).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS or Tailwind (based on specific execution choice), focusing heavily on custom keyframes and `backdrop-filter`.
